<h2>Day One</h2>
<p>First off, I got here at exactly 8:30am. The first train I took was five minutes late. At the subway station the machine wouldn't except my five dollar bill until I tried for the 7th time. Suprisingly it wasn't hard at all to find the entrance when I got off the subway.
  When I got in we had bagels. I tried an everything bagel for the first time, better than I expected. 10/10 would recommend.

<p>We started off with some introductions and did a couple ice breaker exercises to learn names. We learned a couple command line commands.<p>

<p>During lunch I had:
<li>Froyo</li>
<li>Fruit salad</li>
<li>Coconut la croix</li>
<li>Chicken burger on a pretzel bun
</li>
</p>
<p>Another ice breaker, and then we delved right into html and css. </p>

<p>Today was pretty cool.
  The environments really friendly. We tour a short tour and even though we only went through two floors I was stunned. The view of Manhatthan was breathe taking.

</p>
<p> Here's a picture of the entrance:</p>

  <h2>Day Two</h2>
  <p>I got here 45 minutes early for breakfast. I stopped at La Place to check out what they had but wound up eating at Water Tower Cafe. I had:
    <li>Greek yogurt and fruit</li>
    <li>Everything Bagel</li>
    <li>Pineapple Mango Smoothie</li>
    </p>
<p> Back in class we had a choice of two activities: a command line game or advanced css practice.
  I chose the CSS practice, I felt a bit rusty on classes and ids. The activity helped me clearly define a class vs an id.
