<h2>Day One</h2>
<p>First off, I got here at exactly 8:30am. The first train I took was five minutes late. At the subway station the machine wouldn't except my five dollar bill until I tried for the 7th time. Suprisingly it wasn't hard at all to find the entrance when I got off the subway.
  When I got in we had bagels. I tried an everything bagel for the first time, better than I expected. 10/10 would recommend.

<p>During lunch I had
<li>Froyo</li>
<li>Fruit salad</li>
<li>Coconut la croix</li>
<li>Chicken burger on a pretzel bun
</li>
</p>

<p>Today was pretty cool.
  The environments really friendly. We tour a short tour and even though we only went through two floors I was stunned. The view of Manhatthan was breathe taking.
